We build developer tools for .NET.

Datafication is a data platform SDK for loading, transforming, storing, and serving data entirely within .NET. It includes a columnar storage engine with O(1) updates and automatic compaction, a query API with familiar operations like Where, GroupBy, Merge, and window functions, native vector search and ML integration through ONNX, and connectors for CSV, JSON, Excel, Parquet, ADO.NET, S3, and web PIs. One SDK, no glue code.

Verso is an open source (MIT) interactive notebook platform for .NET. It supports pluggable language kernels, custom cell types, theming, and switchable layout engines. Built as a community response to the deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks, Verso runs as both a VS Code extension and a standalone Blazor web application. All features use the same public extension interfaces available to third party developers.
