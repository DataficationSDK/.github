Datafication is a .NET data platform for developers who need more than a DataFrame library. Store data in VelocityDataBlock, a columnar storage engine with O(1) updates, segmented files, and automatic compaction. Query with familiar operations like Where, Select, GroupBy, Merge, and window functions on in-memory or persisted data. Search vectors natively. Embed text, store vectors, and run similarity queries without external services. Integrate ML models with built-in ONNX runtime, tokenizers, and transformer embeddings. Connect to anything: CSV, JSON, Excel, Parquet, ADO.NET, and web APIs. Blazor and Jupyter are ready. One SDK. No glue code. From raw data to production.
