  Datafication is a .NET data platform for developers who need more than a DataFrame library.
  Store data in VelocityDataBlock — a columnar storage engine with O(1) updates, segmented files, and automatic compaction.
  Query with familiar operations — Where, Select, GroupBy, Merge, Window functions — on in-memory or persisted data.
  Search vectors natively — embed text, store vectors, run similarity queries without external services.
  Integrate ML models — ONNX runtime, tokenizers, and transformer embeddings built in.
  Connect to anything — CSV, JSON, Excel, Parquet, ADO.NET, web APIs. Blazor and Jupyter ready.
  One SDK. No glue code. From raw data to production.
